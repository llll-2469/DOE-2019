\item \textbf{Hardware, software, performance and other service work contributions:}

        \begin{itemize}
       	 \item Hardware contribution: I contributed to installing and commissioning of 12 BMG chambers during 2017 winter shut down. I am also studying space charge effect in MDT chambers by looking at readout charge gain and spatial resolution.
        \end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Analysis Contributions:}

        \begin{itemize}
       	 \item For Conf Note 1, I contributed to $H \rightarrow XX \rightarrow 4\ell$ High mass part in: Z Veto cut optimization, cross check of cutflow, cross check of systematic variation and upper limit setting using toy Monte Carlo (Figure ~\ref{fig:Rongkun_ZdZd_Limit}).
        \end{itemize}
        
        \begin{itemize}
       	 \item I am making major contributions to inclusive m4l unfolding analysis, including unfolding method study, optimization of binning and statistical tests using Bayesian reasoning.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \begin{itemize}
       	 \item I contributed in HZZ group for several analyses in evaluating qqZZ theory uncertainties, including showering, scale and pdf systematics.
        \end{itemize}
